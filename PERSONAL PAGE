 Hi! My name is Vansh, and I’m currently a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I’m passionate about blending problem-solving with innovation, and I’m especially interested in exploring the intersection of mechanical design, robotics, and computer science.

In addition to my coursework, I enjoy collaborating on projects that push boundaries, whether it’s coding in Unity, developing GitHub repositories with my peers, or diving deep into research topics like AI and extended reality (XR). I’m always eager to learn new skills and stay updated with emerging trends in technology and engineering.

When I’m not busy studying or working on group projects, I enjoy writing, reading, and playing video games. These hobbies fuel my creativity and allow me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective. I also value communication and teamwork, which I believe are essential for both academic success and future professional growth.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or share ideas—whether it’s about mechanical engineering, software development, or anything in between!
